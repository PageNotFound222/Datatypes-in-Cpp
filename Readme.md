# EXPERIMENT 2 To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types In C++)
## NAME:PRATHAMESH GALPHADE

THEORY:Data Types Overview
SOFTWARE USED:VS CODE

In C++, data types define the kind of data a variable can store. When a variable is declared, the compiler allocates memory for it based on its data type. Each data type uses a different amount of memory, and C++ offers a variety to choose from depending on the needs of your program.

Character Data Type (char):
The char data type is used to store a single character, like 'A' or '9'. It takes up 1 byte of memory and can represent up to 256 different characters based on ASCII values.

Integer Data Type (int):
The int type is for whole numbers, both positive and negative. It typically takes up 4 bytes on 64-bit systems and can store values ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. It supports different number systems like binary, octal, and hexadecimal.

Boolean Data Type (bool):
The bool type is used to store logical values: either true or false. It only takes 1 byte of memory and is perfect for conditions and decision-making in code.

Floating Point & Double Data Types (float and double):
A float stores numbers with decimals using 4 bytes of memory and supports a wide range of values. For even more precision, double is usedâ€”it takes 8 bytes and can handle much larger and more accurate decimal numbers.

IMPLEMENTATION: In this datatype i observed the different datatypes and knew their sizes determination 

CONCLUSION:In this practical i discovered about various types of datatypes available in c++.
